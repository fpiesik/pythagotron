Pythagoras of Samos was a man with many hobbys. I know him for his experiments with strings and their musical properties. Thats why I call this robotic string instrument “Pythagotron”.

It features:

-2 octaves of pitch range
-fast and precise intonation
-4 actuators for striking, muting, punshing, damping and shorten the string
-modular and parametric design (OpenScad)
-most parts are 3D-printed or easy to gather
-open source


It's a parametric design made with OpenScad. You can view the all pieces put together by opening the file /print/pythagotron.scad. This preview differs a little from the actual way I put it together (see pictures).
To change to the parameters, open /print/configuration.scad. You can also view or export every piece by opening the corresponding .scad file and uncomment the module at the end of the file.
